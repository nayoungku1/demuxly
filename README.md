# DEMUXLY ðŸ§¶: Single cell RNA-seq data demultiplexing algorithm

## Setup
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Sample Dataset
* **10k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry)**: Universal 3' Gene Expression dataset analyzed using Cell Ranger 3.0.0
  * Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor.
  * PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell).
